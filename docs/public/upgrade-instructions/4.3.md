# Instructions to upgrade to Cordova plugin version to 4.3

## New application signature algorithm

The application signature (secret) is now calculated using new algorithm that takes Google Play Store metadata into account. This algorithm is
different than the one used by the Application Signature Calculator v1.x. Therefore, if you want to use the Application Signature Calculator you must
use the updated v2.x

## Minimum supported Token Server Version 6.5.0

Due to the SDK initialization improvement you need to update the Token Server to at least version 6.5.0 first.
